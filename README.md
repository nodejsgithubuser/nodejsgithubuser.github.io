# My Online Profile

### Interests and Skills
My primary focus is on web development using Node.js and ASP.NET Core. I have experience using many of the popular client-side JavaScript frameworks such as React and Angular. I am knowledgeable of both relational and non-relational databases (MongoDB, MySQL, etc.) and ORM/ODM tools (EF Core, Mongoose, etc.). I have used popular JavaScript build/development tools such as Webpack, Babel, Gulp. I have experience constructing simple REST APIs and have studied other API frameworks such as GraphQL.

### Education
I have completed coursework in the areas of networking, network security, operating systems, programming languages, databases, algorithms, design patterns, data structures, distributed systems, linear algebra and computer graphics.
